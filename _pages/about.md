I am an assistant professor in computer science at UC Santa Barbara.
I co-direct the [Systems and Networking Lab (SNL)](https://snl.cs.ucsb.edu/).

<!-- I received my Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University. -->

As a systems researcher, I design and build systems that solve the real-world problems at the intersection of networking, internet measurements, and machine learning.


### Prospective Students
Join us in shaping a more equitable digital world!
If you are interested in building systems for network measurements and management for a more inclusive digital future, come work with us.
Please find more details about my **research** [here](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~arpitgupta/research/).

<!-- 🆕 I am actively looking for Ph.D. students and post-docs for my group. -->

<!-- I also actively work with undergraduate students through different existing programs, such as DIMAP, ERSP, Cal-Bridge, etc.
I also mentor students outside UCSB on their undergraduate thesis projects and regularly host visiting students.  

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. -->
