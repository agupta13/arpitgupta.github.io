I am currently an assistant professor in computer science at UC Santa Barbara. At UCSB, I co-direct the [Systems and Networking Lab (SNL)](https://snl.cs.ucsb.edu/).
<!-- I am also affiliated with UCSB's Center for Responsible Machine Learning (CRML).  -->
I received my Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University.

As a systems researcher, I design and build flexible, scalable, and trustworthy
systems that solve the real-world problems at the intersection of networking,
security, and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in developing
**self-driving networks** that use **programmable data planes** and **machine
learning** to provide highly available, reliable, performant and secure
network connectivity at *lower costs* to **under-served** communities.

I work with different industry partners, such as Microsoft Research, Tencent, Verizon, ViaSat, ATT, Intel, Ookla, etc., on problems related to development and deployment of ML-based artifacts for networking.


Please find more details about my current research [here](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~arpitgupta/research/).

### Prospective Students
If you are interested in learning how to develop and deploy production-ready ML-based solutions for networking, come work with us.

üÜï I am actively looking for Ph.D. students and post-docs for my group.

I also actively work with undergraduate students at UCSB through different programs (DIMAP, ERSP, etc.). I mentor students outside UCSB on their undergraduate thesis projects and regularly host visiting students.  

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
