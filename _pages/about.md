I am an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara](https://cs.ucsb.edu/), Faculty Scientist at [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/), and Marjorie & Charles Benton Opportunity Fund Fellow at [Benton Institute](https://www.benton.org/).


<!-- I received my Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University. -->

<!-- As a systems researcher, I design and build systems that solve the real-world problems at the intersection of networking, internet measurements, and machine learning. -->
I co-direct the [Systems and Networking Lab (SNL)](https://snl.cs.ucsb.edu/) at UCSB, where I have been utilizing my system-building skills to address a variety of pressing digital inequity challenges, namely, ensuring secure, performant, and affordable "Internet for All." To this end, my current research focuses on democratizing the development of production-ready ML artifacts for self-driving networks (to ensure performant and secure connectivity with limited infrastructure and operational resources) and enabling data-driven policymaking (to ensure performant and affordable connectivity with limited capital resources).
<!-- 
I also serve on Technical Advisory Board for two "ML for Networking" companies: [Beegol](https://beegol.com/) and [Meter](https://www.meter.com/). -->


<!-- aim to design and build systems that solve fundamental problems at the intersection of networking, internet measurements, and machine learning that contribute to addressing digital inequity issues. Currently, my research focuses: (1) enabling data-driven (broadband) policymaking, and (2) developing production-ready AI/ML artifacts. Here, data-driven policymaking is crucial for optimizing the use of limited capital resources to benefit underprivileged communities, thereby addressing their specific needs more effectively. The latter facilitates the development of *self-driving networks* capable of safely operating production networks with minimal human intervention. Such artifacts would prove especially beneficial in network environments with limited budgets, operational capacity, and technical expertise, such as community networks serving underprivileged and underrepresented communities. -->

<!-- 
### Prospective Students
Join us in shaping a more equitable digital world!
I am actively looking for Ph.D. students to join my group. 
In the next few years, our research group would extensively focus on developing network foundation models to further democratize the development of production-ready ML artifacts for self-driving networks and enabling data-driven policymaking.
Please check out this invited [talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y5R40wNPrFmuTmp9qKRFbwqFh_wVB1YZ/edit#slide=id.p1) that I recently gave at [Monterey Data Conference'24](https://www.montereydataconference.org/program-2024) to get a gist of where we are headed as a research group.  
Please find more details about my **research** [here](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~arpitgupta/research/).

If you are interested, please reach out to me over email. I value diversity and inclusion in my research group and encourage applications from underrepresented groups. Also, it would help if you express genuine interest in the research problems that I am working on by reading some of our recent research papers.  -->

<!-- **Note**: I am not an ML researcher, i.e., I do not make fundamental contributions to AI/ML algorithms that could be applied broadly to any application domain. I am a networked systems researcher who uses AI/ML to only solve networking problems.  -->

<!-- 🆕 I am actively looking for Ph.D. students and post-docs for my group. -->

<!-- I also actively work with undergraduate students through different existing programs, such as DIMAP, ERSP, Cal-Bridge, etc.
I also mentor students outside UCSB on their undergraduate thesis projects and regularly host visiting students.  

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. -->
