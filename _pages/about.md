I am an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara](https://cs.ucsb.edu/), and Faculty Scientist at [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/).
I co-direct the [Systems and Networking Lab (SNL)](https://snl.cs.ucsb.edu/) at UCSB.

<!-- I received my Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University. -->

<!-- As a systems researcher, I design and build systems that solve the real-world problems at the intersection of networking, internet measurements, and machine learning. -->
At SNL, I have been utilizing my system-building skills to address a variety of pressing digital inequity challenges, namely, ensuring secure, performant, and affordable "Internet for All." To this end, my current research focuses on democratizing the development of production-ready ML artifacts for self-driving networks (to ensure performant and secure connectivity with limited infrastructure and operational resources) and enabling data-driven policymaking (to ensure performant and affordable connectivity with limited capital resources).


<!-- aim to design and build systems that solve fundamental problems at the intersection of networking, internet measurements, and machine learning that contribute to addressing digital inequity issues. Currently, my research focuses: (1) enabling data-driven (broadband) policymaking, and (2) developing production-ready AI/ML artifacts. Here, data-driven policymaking is crucial for optimizing the use of limited capital resources to benefit underprivileged communities, thereby addressing their specific needs more effectively. The latter facilitates the development of *self-driving networks* capable of safely operating production networks with minimal human intervention. Such artifacts would prove especially beneficial in network environments with limited budgets, operational capacity, and technical expertise, such as community networks serving underprivileged and underrepresented communities. -->


### Prospective Students
Join us in shaping a more equitable digital world!
If you are interested in building systems for a more inclusive digital future, come work with us.
Please find more details about my **research** [here](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~arpitgupta/research/).

<!-- üÜï I am actively looking for Ph.D. students and post-docs for my group. -->

<!-- I also actively work with undergraduate students through different existing programs, such as DIMAP, ERSP, Cal-Bridge, etc.
I also mentor students outside UCSB on their undergraduate thesis projects and regularly host visiting students.  

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. -->

Kudos to [Chris Misa](https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~cmisa/) for all the hard work and perseverance. This is the first work that demonstrates how we can leverage the fractal (self-similar) nature of IP addresses to design a more effective DDoS defense system, targeted primarily for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This work is in line with my various ongoing efforts in our group that aim to ensure *secure and performant Internet connectivity for All*.
