I am currently an assistant professor in computer science at UC Santa Barbara. At UCSB, I co-direct the Systems and Networking Lab (SNL). I am also affiliated with UCSB's Center for Responsible Machine Learning (CRML). I received my Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University.

As a systems researcher, I design and build flexible, scalable, and deployable systems that solve the real-world problems at the intersection of networking, security, and machine learning. Currently, my focus is on making distributed network-telemetry system scalable and robust to traffic dynamics, and building self-driving network-management systems for access networks. Please find more details about my current research here.
