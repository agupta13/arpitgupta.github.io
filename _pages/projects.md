## Research Philosophy
My research focuses on making self-driving networks, i.e., networks that can run themselves, a reality. Though, self-driving networks are incredibly valuable for any type of network, be it data-center networks, wide-area networks, inter-domain networks, or the last-mile networks. My specific focus is on the last-mile networks, where self-driving networks have the potential to bring down the cost of offering high-quality access to under-privileged communities. 

Building self-diving networks requires closing the network control loop. Recent advances in the distributed system, machine learning, and programmable data plane have provided the technological impetus required to achieve this goal. Our group has been leading and contributing to the development of self-driving networks. Our efforts can be divided into four categories.

 <!-- which entails flexible/scalable data collection and analysis and programmable network control.

(1) a flexible and scalable data-collection pipeline; (2) develop learning algorithms that can decide what data to collect, when to collect   -->
