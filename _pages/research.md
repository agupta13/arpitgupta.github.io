## Self-Driving Networks

The long-term research goal for [Systems and Networking Lab (SNL)](https://snl.cs.ucsb.edu/) is to develop **self-driving networks**, i.e., build networks that can run themselves with minimal intervention. Specifically, our goal is to build self-driving last-mile networks (e.g., cable, mobile, satellite, etc.) that can lower the cost of operating highly *available*, *reliable*, *performant*, and *secure* network connectivity, highly desired for **under-served** communities.

To this end, our group explores how we can
(1) enable **accurate and flexible (streaming) analytics** over network data at scale;
(2) lower the threshold to **curate high-quality datasets** for different learning problems from diverse network environments at scale;
(3) develop **generalizable and robust learning models** that can both accurately assess the network's state and take effective actions to keep networks performant and secure; and
(4) **establish trust** in ML-based artifacts so network operators feel confident enough to relinquish control to these artifacts in production settings.

<!-- machine learning (ML) and
programmable network data planes to develop *low-cost* last-mile networks that can provide highly *available*, *reliable*, *performant* and *secure* network connectivity to underrepresented and under-served communities.

<!-- The growing popularity of networked devices and applications imposes
increasingly stringent security- and performance-related requirements on the
underlying communication fabric. Satisfying these ever-increasing demands with
limited infrastructure and operational budgets are challenging for the network
operators. -->

<!-- My research combines the flexibility of **programmable data-plane targets** and
the intelligibility of **ML algorithms** to develop ML-based artifacts for
networking that bridge the fundamental gap between requirements and resources.
Additionally, my research focuses on ensuring that network operators can
**trust** these ML-based artifacts enough to deploy them in production
settings.  -->

<!-- The proposed research will help catalyze adoption of ML-based solutions for network operations, which will form the intellectual foundation for future self-driving networks. My academic career to this point has prepared me to pursue this goal with an extensive experience in developing open-sourced networked systems, such as SDX~\cite{sdx}, iSDX~\cite{isdx}, Sonata~\cite{sonata-paper}, DynamiQ~\cite{dynamiq}, Optel~\cite{optel}, etc., that have been widely used in both academia and industry.  -->
