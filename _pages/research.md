## Self-Driving Networks

The long-term research goal for [Systems and Networking Lab (SNL)](https://snl.cs.ucsb.edu/) is to develop **self-driving networks** that can run themselves with minimal intervention.
Given our group's focus on digital equity issues, we focus primarily on building self-driving network for last-mile community networks.
Our goal is to lower the cost of deploying and operating highly *available*, *reliable*, *performant*, and *secure* last-mile networks in under-served communities.

Achieving this goal requires solving various fundamental research problems, which includes answering how we can
* Enable **accurate and flexible (streaming) analytics** over network data at scale (see [Sonata](#), [DynamiQ](#), [Panakos](#), [OpTel](#));
* Lower the threshold to **curate high-quality datasets** for different learning problems from diverse network environments at scale (see [PINOT](#), [netUnicorn](#));
* Develop **generalizable and robust learning models** that can both accurately assess the network's state and take effective actions to keep networks performant and secure (see [netUnicorn](#), [Trustee](#)); and
* **Establish trust** in ML-based artifacts so network operators feel confident enough to relinquish control to these artifacts in production settings (see [Trustee](#)).

### Related Projects
Some of the projects that provide a decent sample of ongoing research activities at SNL:

- [PINOT](https://pinot.cs.ucsb.edu/): A programmable data-collection infrastructure at UCSB to collect fine-grained (labeled) network data at scale.
- [netUnicorn](https://netunicorn.cs.ucsb.edu/): A data-collection platform that simplifies collecting network data for different learning problems from diverse network environments.
- [Trustee](https://trusteeml.github.io/): A framework that cracks open decision-making for black-box ML models (for networks) using high-fidelity, low-complexity, and stable decision trees.

programmable network data planes to develop *low-cost* last-mile networks that can provide highly *available*, *reliable*, *performant* and *secure* network connectivity to underrepresented and under-served communities.

<!-- The growing popularity of networked devices and applications imposes
increasingly stringent security- and performance-related requirements on the
underlying communication fabric. Satisfying these ever-increasing demands with
limited infrastructure and operational budgets are challenging for the network
operators. -->

<!-- My research combines the flexibility of **programmable data-plane targets** and
the intelligibility of **ML algorithms** to develop ML-based artifacts for
networking that bridge the fundamental gap between requirements and resources.
Additionally, my research focuses on ensuring that network operators can
**trust** these ML-based artifacts enough to deploy them in production
settings.  -->
