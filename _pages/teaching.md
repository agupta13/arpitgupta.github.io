### Teaching Philosophy
I usually teach courses that train students on basic and advanced networking topics. I also teach a graduate-level course about applying machine-learning tools to networking problems. My approach is to share the perspective of network designers, researchers, and operators with the students. Such an approach helps appreciate how to community converged on various design choices to develop networking protocols and applications. In my lectures, I pay special attention to instilling excitement about the material and helping students discover new interests. For example, in my classes, rather
than speaking exclusively in the abstract, I use real-world network data and configurations from UCSB's production network to explain various network and application-layer protocols.

We need to train students to understand the design spectrum for any new networking protocol and system. Then we should show them how various tradeoffs in the design space dictated the choices made by various existing protocols and techniques. We should also expose students to recent research advancements and help them understand the motivations and design tradeoffs. I try to highlight the ever-evolving nature of the networking field and how they can contribute to making an impact of their own in the future.
To offer a better hands-on experience, I translate cutting-edge research into programming assignments. It not only exposes
students to the latest developments in the area and add a new dimension to the research itself.
